This is or was a normal practice day for me in the morning.
Alarm
Weight Room
Walking 
Door opening 
Dive into the pool
Swimming
This is all I've included so far and have been enjoying playing with all the different effects
Now I have added a heavy sigh just after the alarm
About a minute and 40 seconds
